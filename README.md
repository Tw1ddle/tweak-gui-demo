# tweak-gui demo

This repository contains unfinished demos for the unfinished *tweak-gui* library, a Haxe library that provides a **simple to use** graphical user interface for changing variables on the fly. This is completely unfinished and untested, don't use this.

## Usage

FlashDevelop ```.hxproj``` or Haxe ```.hxml``` files are included for each backend that tweak-gui supports.
